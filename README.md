- Quick Response to the passengers.
- Automation and integration of Airline system functions.
- Higher productivity and effective management
- Security and protection of confidential data.
- Transaction management and routing.

All user/agents are allocated  a SINE code, which is used during sine-on and then appended to all transactions carried out by the agent for security purpose.
Different security levels may be assigned so that different agents can access different areas of the system and also different records in the case where a travel agent is only allowed to review PNR’s  that have been created by that agency.

Flights may be entered as far ahead as required without limitation using the flight inventory GUI. Native transactions support reservations up to 1 year ahead.
The flights  may be specified within a particular date range and may be used to display different classes  of service and different fares within a specific seating class.
